# Building AI Intensive Python Applications

## Chapter 10 - Refining the Semantic Data Model to Improve Accuracy

The Python Jupyter Notebooks in this directory demonstrate various techniques
for improving the accuracy of semantic search.

To run these code examples, you must first install Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
pip3 install notebook
```

Then you can start the Jupyter Notebook server from the command line:

```sh
jupyter notebook .
```

This opens a new tab in your web browser with the Chapter 10 Jupyter Notebooks.

Inside of each notebook, you can run each cell by clicking on it and pressing `Shift+Enter`. All code for each notebook is contained within the notebook itself.

Note that to run any notebook that uses the OpenAI API, you must get an OpenAI API key. For more information on getting your OpenAI API key, refer to the OpenAI documentation <https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key>.
